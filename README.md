Creating AI agents using RAGs that are fine-tuned to serve as AI tutors on topics in Computer Vision

1. I would like to see some examples of questions by a student and the answers provided by this AI tutor based on the reference document(use the document quotes). For example, a few questions--
->What is the principle of stereo vision for 3D shape measurement?
->What are intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, and how are they obtained through calibration?
->What is the epipolar constraint, and how does it help with stereo image matching?

2. In terms of actually helping a student to learn new topics like stereo vision, 
Multimedia output
-> Some diagrams and equations would be helpful. If there are some AI tutors somewhere online that offer 
->text+diagrams+equations and possibly program snippets, flow-chart of algorithms, video, etc.,
